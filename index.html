          <div class="ingredients">
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            
            <p>You can’t make a pizza without the raw materials. Flour or prepared dough, tomatoes or prepared sauce, cheese, and toppings each cost the pizzeria. Many pizzerias order from distributors like Sysco, US Foods, ACE Endico, or Ferraro Foods, and those will also charge a pizzeria for delivery, a cost called freight. Others will purchase their own ingredients at warehouse stores like Jetro or Restaurant Depot, which typically offer lower prices than distributors.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="rent">
            <h4>Rent</h4>
            
            <p>Most pizzerias in New York City don’t own their own buildings. The average retail rent in the Bronx is <a href=”https://www.loopnet.com/search/retail-space/bronx-ny/for-lease/7/”>$51.47</a> per square foot per month, and an average pizzeria is around 500-1000 square feet.</p>
          </div> 

          <div class="payroll">
            <h4>Payroll</h4>
            
            <p>Pizzerias, on average, <a href=”https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/employment/pizza-restaurants-united-states/”>employ about six people</a>. In the past, pizzerias were frequently family affairs, with multiple family members working in the shop, but these days, many rely on outside employees.</p>
          </div>  

          <div class="fees"> 
            <h4>Fees</h4>
            
            <p>There are other fees to doing business, too, such as credit card fees and fees for apps like DoorDash and GrubHub. Those apps typically take about 30% of the restaurant’s revenue on each order.</p>
          </div>  

          <div class="utilities">
            <h4>Utilities & Fuel</h4>
            
            <p>Gas, electric, heating and air conditioning are big deals to pizzerias, too. Electric ovens are <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/dining/new-york-pizza-electric-ovens.html”>more efficient than older types</a>, but the classic New York Slice comes from a gas oven. And in addition to buying coal or wood for an oven, New York City <a href=”https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nyc-sets-deadline-for-pizzerias-to-cut-down-pollutants”>recently mandated</a> that pizzerias with those ovens take steps to mitigate their pollution.</p>

          <div class="marketing">
            <h4>Marketing</h4>
            
            <p>Don’t forget spreading the word to customers. Printing menus, running social media pages, and any other advertising all costs money, too—plus paying an employee to handle marketing.</p>
          </div>   

          <div class="everythingElse">
            <h4>Everything Else</h4>
            
            <p>Thought that was it? Like other restaurant owners, pizzerias pay for permits, insurance, garbage collection, cleaning, maintenance, and of course, taxes. It all adds up for pizzeria owners, who say customers don’t realize why they’re paying a higher price for their food. Maggie Mieles of Brooklyn’s Di Fara Pizzeria says sometimes customers complain about the $5 slice price. “But if they saw our invoices,” she says, “then they’d pay $10 a slice!”</p>

            <p>Thought that was it? Like other restaurant owners, pizzerias pay for permits, insurance, garbage collection, cleaning, maintenance, and of course, taxes. It all adds up for pizzeria owners, who say customers don’t realize why they’re paying a higher price for their food. Maggie Mieles of Brooklyn’s Di Fara Pizzeria says sometimes customers complain about the $5 slice price. “But if they saw our invoices,” she says, “then they’d pay $10 a slice!”</p>
